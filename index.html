    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are a way to group multiple items together. They're a way to
      represent a list of things.
    </p>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Loops let us repeat a line of code multiple times. Like the if statement,
      a loop is one of the most useful constructs in programming.
    </p>
    <h2>While Loops</h2>
    <p>
      While loops will run until the condition in their brackets is false.
      They're useful when you don't know how many times you want to run the
      loop.
